# Roasted Carrot and Black Pepper Tofu Salad with Carrot Top Cilantro Dressing

## Ingredients

- 1 big bag of Mixed greens
- 8 oz Feta cheese, cubed or crumbled
- 1/2 cup French (green) lentils
- 1/4 cup Pumpkin seeds or 2 tbsp hemp hearts (I like the extra bit of protein/fat here)

### For the roasted carrots

- 1 bunch Baby carrots, with carrot tops attached (I'd estimate it to be about 8oz for just the baby carrots. You could also probably use some nice looking rainbow carrots, but cut them down to matchsticks)
- 1/2 tbsp Olive oil
- 1 tsp Balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 tsp Salt

### For the black pepper tofu

- 1 package extra firm Tofu, cubed into 1/4 inch cubes
- 1/2 tbsp Cornstarch
- 1/4 tsp Black pepper
- 1/2 tsp Grated fresh ginger (I grate frozen chunks directly on the tofu with a microplane)
- 1 tbsp Soy sauce

### For the carrot top cilantro dressing

- 1 large bunch Carrot tops, cleaned and very roughly chopped
- 1 small bunch Cilantro (I ended up using half a prepacked amount)
- 1/4 cup Brown rice vinegar, or another neutral vinegar (apple cider, etc)
- 1/2 cup Olive oil
- 1/2 tbsp Honey
- 1/2 tsp Dried garlic, onion, chives, and other dried or fresh herbs (whatever you have on hand, really)
- 1/4 tsp Red Pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp Salt

## Directions

### For the roasted carrots

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Clean baby carrots, separating the greens and saving them for the dressing. (I like to just clean them well, removing any root floss and leave them unpeeled.)
3. Toss baby carrots with 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp balsamic vinegar, and 1/4 tsp salt.
4. Lay out on baking sheet so there's some space between the carrots. (It doesn't have to be exact, but some space helps the carrots roast a little better).
5. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the skin on the baby carrots looks a little wrinkly and they're just starting to get some brown spots.

### For the black pepper tofu

1. Heat 2 tbsp of neutral oil in a skillet on medium heat. (I like to use avocado oil)
2. Lightly coat the tofu cubes in cornstarch.
3. Add to hot pan, flipping the tofu every few minutes to get it a little brown.
4. While your eye is on the tofu, add black pepper and grated ginger to the tofu and stir a little to distribute on the cubes.
5. When the tofu cubes are lightly browned, add in the soy sauce and stir to coat the cubes. It should only take a few seconds for the soy sauce to really stick and brown the cubes more. Remove them from heat.

### For the carrot top cilantro dressing

1. In a food processer, add the carrot tops and cilantro. Pulse to chop up.
2. Then add in the olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. Process into a sauce, adding in more liquid if needed.
3. Make sure you taste test the sauce to see if it needs more salt, vinegar or sweetness! It should come out to a very chunky sauce, but when it all gets combined into the salad, it'll leave a beautiful herby coating over everything.

### For the french lentils

1. Add 1/2 cup lentils and 1 cup water to a sauce pan and heat on the stove on medium heat. Stir every so often. When the water is gone, the lentils should be a little bit on the al dente side and not mushy.

### Assemble the salad

When you're ready, toss all the ingredients together. I like to keep the ingredients in separate containers in my fridge until I'm ready, but you could probably combine everything save the dressing and then add that in right before serving.
