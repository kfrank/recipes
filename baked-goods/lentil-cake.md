# Lentil cake

It's a "cake" because you bake it in a 9x9 dish like brownies, but it's savory and delicious! Great for breakfast with a glass of chocolate milk, or as a protein-filled snack.

- 1 cup red lentils
- 1/2 cup full or half fat yogurt
- 8oz feta cheese, cut into small cubes
- 16oz savory turkey or chicken sausage
- 1 egg
- 10 oz baby spinach, rough chop
- 2 tbs dill, chopped
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Prepare a greased 9x9 baking dish.
2. Cook red lentils. (I put it in the instant pot on high pressure for 4 minutes.)
3. Combine red lentils with yogurt, eggs, feta, sausage, egg, spinach, and dill.
4. Mix in the flour, baking powder, and salt.
5. Bake in oven for 45-60 minutes.
